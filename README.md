# Project Euler 030 - Digit Fifth Powers

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

   1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
   8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
   9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4

As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum, it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634+8208+9474 = 19316

The aim is to find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of the fifth powers of their digits.
